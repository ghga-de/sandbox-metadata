Recently, Lam et al. have performed a detailed comparison of two next-generation sequencing technologies with respect to their sensitivity to call single nucleotide variants (SNV) and indels. Here, we sequenced two tumor/normal pairs obtained from two paedriatic medulloblastoma patients with Life Technologies’ SOLiD 4 and 5500xl SOLiD, Illumina’s HiSeq2000, and Complete Genomics’ technology.  We then compared their ability to call SNVs with high confidence. As gold standard for SNV calling, we used genotypes determined by an Affymetrix SNP array. Additionally, we performed a detailed analysis of how evenly each technology covers the genome and how the reads are distributed across functional genomic regions. Finally, we studied how a combination of data from different technologies might help to overcome the limitations in SNV calling by any of the four technologies alone.",

    "description": "As new generations of targeted therapies emerge and tumor genome sequencing discovers increasingly comprehensive mutation repertoires, the functional relationships of mutations to tumor phenotypes remain largely unknown. Here, we measured ex vivo sensitivity of 246 blood cancers to 63 drugs alongside genome, transcriptome, and DNA methylome analysis to understand determinants of drug response. We assembled a primary blood cancer cell encyclopedia data set that revealed disease-specific sensitivities for each cancer. Within chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), responses to 62% of drugs were associated with 2 or more mutations, and linked the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway to trisomy 12, an important driver of CLL. Based on drug responses, the disease could be organized into phenotypic subgroups characterized by exploitable dependencies on BCR, mTOR, or MEK signaling and associated with mutations, gene expression, and DNA methylation. Fourteen percent of CLLs were driven by mTOR signaling in a non–BCR-dependent manner. Multivariate modeling revealed immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) mutation status and trisomy 12 as the most important modulators of response to kinase inhibitors in CLL. Ex vivo drug responses were associated with outcome. This study overcomes the perception that most mutations do not influence drug response of cancer, and points to an updated approach to understanding tumor biology, with implications for biomarker discovery and cancer care.",

In contrast, the role of FGFR1 in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) has not been established. Prompted by the detection and subsequent therapeutic inhibition of amplified FGFR1 in a patient with metastatic leiomyosarcoma, we investigated the oncogenic properties and potential as drug target of FGFR1 in STS.Experimental Design: The frequency of FGFR1 amplification and overexpression, as assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization and mRNA expression profiling, SNP array profiling, and RNA sequencing, was determined in three independent patient cohorts. The sensitivity of STS cell lines with or without FGFR1 alterations to genetic and pharmacologic FGFR1 inhibition and the signaling pathways engaged by FGFR1 were investigated using short-term viability assays, long-term colony formation assays, and biochemical analysis.Results: Increased FGFR1 copy number was detected in 74 of 190 (38.9%; Cohort 1), 13 of 79 (16.5%; Cohort 2), and 80 of 254 (31.5%; Cohort 3) patients. FGFR1 overexpression occurred in 16 of 79 (20.2%, Cohort 2) and 39 of 254 (15.4%; Cohort 3) patients. Targeting of FGFR1 by short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown and different small-molecule inhibitors (PD173074, AZD4547, BGJ398) revealed that the requirement for FGFR1 signaling in STS cells is primarily dictated by FGFR1 expression levels, and identified the MAPK-ERK1/2 axis as critical FGFR1 effector pathway.Conclusion: These data identify FGFR1 as driver gene in multiple STS subtypes and support FGFR1 inhibition, guided by patient selection according to FGFR1 expression and monitoring of MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling, as therapeutic option in this challenging group of diseases.H021",

Currently, clinical decision making in patients with CUP primarily relies on histopathology and clinical features. Comprehensive molecular profiling has the potential to contribute to diagnostic categorization and, most importantly, guide CUP therapy through identification of actionable lesions. We here report the case of an advanced-stage malignancy initially mimicking poorly differentiated soft-tissue sarcoma that did not respond to multi-agent chemotherapy. Molecular profiling within a clinical whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing program revealed a heterozygous, highly amplified KRAS G12S mutation, compound-heterozygous TP53 mutation/deletion, high mutational load, and focal amplification of chromosomes 9p (including PDL1 [CD274] and JAK2) and 10p (including GATA3). Integrated analysis of molecular data and conventional histopathology suggested a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and provided a rationale for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy with pembrolizumab, which resulted in rapid clinical improvement and a lasting partial remission. Analysis of 157 TNBC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed focal, high-level PDL1 amplification coinciding with excessive PDL1 mRNA expression in 24% of cases. Collectively, these results illustrate the diagnostic utility of multidimensional tumor profiling in cases with non-descript histology and immune phenotype, demonstrate the predictive power of genomic PDL1 amplification for immune checkpoint inhibition, and suggest a targeted therapeutic strategy in chromosome 9p24.1/PDL1-amplified cancers.H021",

Initially, the 48-year old female diagnosed with high-risk APL had achieved complete molecular remission after standard treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy according to the AIDA protocol. 13 months after start of ATRA maintenance the patient suffered clinically overt meningeal relapse along with minute molecular traces of PML/RARA in the bone marrow. Following treatment with arsenic trioxide (ATO) and ATRA in combination with intrathecal cytarabine and methotrexate, the patient achieved a complete molecular remission in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and bone marrow, which currently lasts for two years after completion of therapy. Whole exome sequencing and subsequent ultradeep targeted re-sequencing revealed a heterozygous FLT3-TKD mutation in CSF leukemic cells (p.D835Y, c.2503G&gt;T, 1000/1961 reads (51%)), which was undetectable in the concurrent bone marrow sample. Interestingly, the FLT3-TKD mutated meningeal clone originated from a small bone marrow subclone present in a variant allele frequency of 0.4% (6/1553 reads) at initial diagnosis. This case highlights the concept of clonal evolution with a subclone harboring an additional mutation being selected as the “fittest” and leading to meningeal relapse.

    "description": "Recent developments in sequencing technologies led to the discovery of a novel form of genomic instability, termed chromothripsis. This catastrophic genomic event, involved in tumorigenesis, is characterized by tens to hundreds of simultaneously acquired locally clustered rearrangements on one chromosome. We hypothesized that leukemias developing in individuals with Ataxia Telangiectasia, who are born with two mutated copies of the ATM gene, an essential guardian of genome stability, would show a higher prevalence of chromothripsis due to the associated defect in DNA double-strand break repair. Using whole-genome sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA sequencing, we characterized the genomic landscape of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) arising in patients with Ataxia Telangiectasia. We detected a high frequency of chromothriptic events in these tumors, specifically on acrocentric chromosomes, as compared to tumors from individuals with other types of DNA repair syndromes (27 cases total, 10 with Ataxia Telangiectasia). Our data suggest that the genomic landscape of Ataxia Telangiectasia ALL is clearly distinct from that of sporadic ALL. Mechanistically, short telomeres and compromised DNA damage response in cells of Ataxia Telangiectasia patients may be linked with frequent chromothripsis. Furthermore, we show that ATM loss is associated with increased chromothripsis prevalence in additional tumor entities.",

    "studyAbstract": "Recent developments in sequencing technologies led to the discovery of a novel form of genomic instability, termed chromothripsis. This catastrophic genomic event, involved in tumorigenesis, is characterized by tens to hundreds of simultaneously acquired locally clustered rearrangements on one chromosome. We hypothesized that leukemias developing in individuals with Ataxia Telangiectasia, who are born with two mutated copies of the ATM gene, an essential guardian of genome stability, would show a higher prevalence of chromothripsis due to the associated defect in DNA double-strand break repair. Using whole-genome sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA sequencing, we characterized the genomic landscape of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) arising in patients with Ataxia Telangiectasia.

To understand the mechanism driving protumorigenic skewing in CLL, we evaluated the role of tumor cell–derived exosomes in the cross-talk with monocytes. We carried out RNA sequencing and proteome analyses of CLL-derived exosomes and identified noncoding Y RNA hY4 as a highly abundant RNA species that is enriched in exosomes from plasma of CLL patients compared with healthy donor samples. Transfer of CLL-derived exosomes or hY4 alone to monocytes resulted in key CLL-associated phenotypes, including the release of cytokines, such as C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL4, and interleukin-6, and the expression of PD-L1. These responses were abolished in Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)–deficient monocytes, suggesting exosomal hY4 as a driver of TLR7 signaling. Pharmacologic inhibition of endosomal TLR signaling resulted in a substantially reduced activation of monocytes in vitro and attenuated CLL development in vivo.

These neoantigens can be recognized by the host’s immune system. However, continuous stimulation of immune cells against tumor antigens can lead to immune cell exhaustion, which allows uncontrolled outgrowth of tumor cells. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as a novel approach to overcome immune cell exhaustion and re-activate anti-tumor immune responses.

The effects were particularly pronounced in tumors with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and a high mutational load, which typically occur in the colon and  endometrium. Here, we report on a 24-year old woman diagnosed with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who showed strong and durable response to the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab, although treatment was initiated at an advanced stage of disease. The patient’s tumor displayed DNA mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability (MSI), but lacked other features commonly discussed as predictors of response towards checkpoint blockade, such as PD-L1 expression or dense infiltration with cytotoxic T cells. Notably, high levels of HLA class I and II antigen expression were detected in the tumor, suggesting a potential causal relation between functionality of the tumor’s antigen presentation machinery and the success of immune checkpoint blockade. We suggest determining MSI status in combination with HLA class I and II antigen expression in tumors potentially eligible for immune checkpoint blockade even in the absence of conventional markers predictive for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and in entities not commonly linked to MSI phenotype.

Many clinical applications require high precision, especially if rare events such as somatic mutations in cancer or genetic variants causing rare diseases need to be identified. Although random sequencing errors can be modeled statistically and deep sequencing minimizes their impact, systematic errors remain a problem even at high depth of coverage. Understanding their source is crucial to increase precision of clinical NGS applications. In this work, we studied the relation between recurrent biases in allele balance (AB), systematic errors and false positive variant calls across a large cohort of human samples analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES). We have modeled the allele balance distribution for biallelic genotypes in 987 WES samples in order to identify positions recurrently deviating significantly from the expectation, a phenomenon we termed allele balance bias (ABB). Furthermore, we have developed a genotype callability score based on ABB for all positions of the human exome, which detects false positive variant calls that passed state-of-the-art filters.

    "studyAbstract": "In recent years, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become a cornerstone of clinical genetics and diagnostics. Many clinical applications require high precision, especially if rare events such as somatic mutations in cancer or genetic variants causing rare diseases need to be identified. Although random sequencing errors can be modeled statistically and deep sequencing minimizes their impact, systematic errors remain a problem even at high depth of coverage. Understanding their source is crucial to increase precision of clinical NGS applications. In this work, we studied the relation between recurrent biases in allele balance (AB), systematic errors and false positive variant calls across a large cohort of human samples analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES). We have modeled the allele balance distribution for biallelic genotypes in 987 WES samples in order to identify positions recurrently deviating significantly from the expectation, a phenomenon we termed allele balance bias (ABB). Furthermore, we have developed a genotype callability score based on ABB for all positions of the human exome, which detects false positive variant calls that passed state-of-the-art filters. Finally, we demonstrate the use of ABB for detection of false associations proposed by rare variant association studies (RVAS).",

Using PDO lines newly established from colorectal cancer patients with a standardized workflow, we performed chemical perturbations with more than 500 experimental and clinically used compounds. Subsequently, we captured approx. six million images by confocal microscopy. To analyze drug-induced PDO re-organization on a single organoid level we developed SCOPE, a software framework for automated PDO high-throughput image analysis. We observed a rich variety of divergent and reoccurring compound induced phenotypes in organoids. Perturbation of cellular processes, including signaling by MEK, GSK3β, cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and others, led to recurring and distinct architectural changes. Highlighting the clinical relevance, PDO viability was heterogeneous after perturbation with anticancer drugs and matched clinical response of corresponding colorectal cancer patients.

Our data demonstrates that recurrent and patient-specific mutational patterns can be reliably detected for the majority of patients.

We identified activating mutations (p.Leu755Ser, p.Asp769Tyr, p.Val777Leu) in the catalytic domain of the ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase in schwannomatosis-associated (4 of 8 patients) N/S HNSTs but not in tumors arising in the context of NF (0 of 6 patients), and observed that ERBB2-mutant N/S HNSTs define a distinct subgroup of peripheral nerve sheath tumors based on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns. The small-molecule ERBB inhibitor lapatinib led to prolonged clinical benefit and a lasting radiographic and metabolic response in a patient with schwannomatosis-associated, ERBB2-mutant N/S HNST. These findings uncover a key biological feature of N/S HNST that may have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. (H021)",

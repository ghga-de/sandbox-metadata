            "description": "Mutations that activate the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, in particular BRAFV600E, occur in many cancers, and mutant BRAF-selective inhibitors have clinical activity in these diseases. Activating BRAF alleles are usually considered to be mutually exclusive with mutant RAS, whereas inactivating mutations in the D594F595G596 motif of the BRAF activation segment can coexist with oncogenic RAS and cooperate via paradoxical MEK/ERK activation. We determined the functional consequences of a largely uncharacterized BRAF mutation, F595L, which was detected along with an HRASQ61R allele by clinical exome sequencing in a patient with histiocytic sarcoma and also occurs in epithelial cancers, melanoma, and neuroblastoma, and investigated its interaction with mutant RAS. We demonstrate that, unlike previously described DFG motif mutants, BRAFF595L is a gain-of-function variant with intermediate activity towards MEK that does not act paradoxically, but nevertheless cooperates with mutant RAS to promote oncogenic signaling. Of immediate clinical relevance, BRAFF595L shows divergent responses to different mutant BRAF-selective inhibitors, whereas signaling driven by BRAFF595L with and without mutant RAS is efficiently blocked by pan-RAF and MEK inhibitors. Mutation data from primary patient samples and cell lines show that BRAFF595L, as well as other BRAF mutations with intermediate activity, frequently coincide with mutant RAS in a broad spectrum of cancers. These data define a novel class of activating BRAF mutations that cooperate with oncogenic RAS in a non-paradoxical fashion to achieve an optimal level of MEK-ERK signaling, extend the spectrum of patients with systemic histiocytic disorders and other malignancies who are candidates for therapeutic blockade of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, and underscore the value of comprehensive genetic profiling for understanding the signaling requirements of individual cancers.",

Although the prognosis of ATRT patients is poor, some patients respond very well to current treatments, suggesting inter-tumor molecular heterogeneity. To investigate this further, we genetically and epigenetically analyzed a large cohort of ATRTs (n = 170). Three distinct molecular subgroups of ATRTs, associated with differences in demographics, tumor location and type of SMARCB1 alterations, were identified using DNA-methylation or gene expression analyses. Whole genome DNA- and RNA-sequencing found no other recurrent mutations explaining the differences between subgroups. However, whole genome bisulfite-sequencing and H3K27Ac ChIP-sequencing of primary tumors revealed clear differences in methylation patterns and enhancer landscapes, leading to the identification of subgroup-specific regulatory networks.",
